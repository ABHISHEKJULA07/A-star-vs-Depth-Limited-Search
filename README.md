A* vs. Depth-Limited Search: A Pathfinding Algorithm Comparison 🤖
This repository contains a comprehensive project comparing the performance of two fundamental search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence: A* Search and Depth-Limited Search (DLS). The project evaluates their efficiency, optimality, and memory usage in various pathfinding scenarios. 🚀

Key Features 🎯
Implementation of A* Search: A powerful informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to efficiently find the optimal path. 🗺️

Implementation of Depth-Limited Search (DLS): A variation of Depth-First Search that prevents infinite loops in graphs with cycles by imposing a maximum search depth. 💡

Comparative Analysis: The project provides a clear, side-by-side comparison of the algorithms based on:

Time Complexity: How long each algorithm takes to find a solution.

Space Complexity: The memory required to store the search space.

Optimality: Whether the algorithms guarantee finding the shortest path.

Demonstration Scenarios: The algorithms are applied to solve a pathfinding problem in a grid environment with obstacles to showcase their strengths and weaknesses.

Technologies Used 💻
Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the algorithms.

Data Structures: The project utilizes various data structures, such as lists and queues, to manage the search process.
